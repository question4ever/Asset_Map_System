# Asset_Map_System
An app to track IT assets when those assets are spread across a wide area and multiple buildings. Each building has a different floor 
plan and the goal of this app is to keep track of all those assets and where they are in the school. A future goal is to port this 
application to android so we can use the GPS to track where we are in the building.
